# Background

The use of resources found in space has the potential to transform space exploration.
Resources such as oxygen and water found on the Moon, Mars and Asteroids, can be used as
propellant for rockets, hoppers and other vehicles, in addition to providing life support for future
long-duration human space missions. Oxygen can be produced from lunar dust, or regolith, by
reduction or electrolysis. An end-to-end lunar oxygen production system comprises several
process steps, including collection of the regolith, transport of regolith to a reactor system,
transport of oxygen from the reactor to storage, transport of reduced regolith (metals) to a
manufacturing facility, and finally an end use, which could be in a lunar habitat or in energy
storage (i.e. fuel cells). Operating an entire system is complex and yet to be demonstrated on
Earth or in space. While one company or agency could provide all the units in this system, it is
more likely that each unit or technology will be provided by a separate entity with expertise in
that domain.

EURO2MOON is an association of European industry and institutions that are developing, or
supporting the development of, technology for this new space economy based around the in situ
use of space resources (ISRU, or in situ resource utilization). The association would like to
demonstrate the strength of European industry in this domain by developing an end-to-end
demonstration from regolith to end use of lunar oxygen, making use of the membersâ€™
technologies and expertise.

One aspect that must be designed is the transfer of products between the reactor and the enduser;
key material transfers include:
- Oxygen from reactor to storage
- Oxygen from storage to fuel cell
- Oxygen from storage to habitation
- Oxygen storage tank from production to end-user

This could be in solid, liquid or gas phase. On Earth, transport would likely be by pipeline, but on
the Moon, to maximise flexibility, it can be assumed that a transportation system would include a
mobile platform that can traverse a complex terrain and that can deliver a product.

# Project aim and objectives

In this project, the group will design a mobile platform (i.e. wheeled or legged) to transport
oxygen from one location to another. The mobile platform must be able to traverse a given
distance and terrain, and ideally would be built to receive different storage tank configurations.
Remote operation and/or autonomy can be considered. Functionality to move a storage tank
into position might be included. **The outcome will be a simulation or physical demonstration
of a mobile platform to move oxygen from one location (e.g. the reactor) to another (e.g.
habitation).**
